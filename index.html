  <h1>Global Emotional Index (GEI)</h1>
  <p><strong>A neutral, non-evaluative global reference indicator</strong></p>
  <p>
    The Global Emotional Index (GEI) provides aggregated, anonymized emotional
    pressure context at a global level. It is designed to coexist alongside
    economic, social, and geopolitical indicators as a contextual reference only.
  </p>

<!-- TODAY INDEX -->
<section id="today">
  <h2>Global Emotional Index — Today</h2>

  <p class="status">
    Status: <span class="neutral">Neutral</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    The current GEI value reflects a globally neutral emotional state.
    This does not indicate positive or negative sentiment, but rather a
    balanced global emotional pressure environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    GEI values are not real-time measurements of individual emotions and
    should not be interpreted as forecasts, warnings, or directives.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- WHAT IS GEI -->
<section>
  <h2>What is GEI?</h2>
  <p>
    GEI is an experimental global reference indicator designed to visualize
    aggregated emotional pressure trends using publicly available,
    non-personal, anonymized data sources.
  </p>
  <p>
    It does not measure happiness, sadness, approval, or disapproval of any
    country, government, institution, or population.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- MAP EXPLANATION -->
<section>
  <h2>About the Global Map</h2>
  <p>
    Any visual global representation is symbolic and illustrative only.
    Country borders, colors, or regions do not represent rankings,
    judgments, classifications, or comparisons.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clicking or selecting a country does not provide country-level emotional
    scores and does not imply monitoring, evaluation, or profiling of nations
    or populations.
